# Guess the movie title game

## General info
That's my project on UDACITY, created for learning Java. It is a game where the player gets to guess the movie name given the number of letters in it (pretty much like hangman but with movies).The goal is to try to figure out the movie by guessing one letter at a time or try to guess whole title.
